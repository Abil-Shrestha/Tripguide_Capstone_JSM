    description: `Our Website is a travel search engine. Tripguid does not provide, own or control
  any of the travel services and products that you can access through Our Website, such as flights, accommodations, rental cars, packages, or travel
  insurance (the 'Travel Products'). The Travel Products are owned, controlled or made available by third parties (the 'Travel Providers')
  either directly (e.g., airline) or as an agent (e.g., online travel agency). The Travel Providers are responsible for the Travel Products.
  The Travel Provider&apos;s terms and privacy policies apply to your booking, so you must agree to and understand those terms. Furthermore, the terms of
  the actual travel provider (airline, hotel, tour operator, etc.) apply to your travel, so you must also agree to and understand those terms.
  Your interaction with any Travel Provider accessed through Our Website is at your own risk; KAYAK does not bear any responsibility should anything
  go wrong with your booking or during your travel KAYAK hosts content, including prices, made available by or obtained from Travel Providers.
  KAYAK is in no way responsible for the accuracy, timeliness or completeness of such content. Since KAYAK has no control over the Travel Products and does not
  verify the content uploaded by the Travel Providers, it is not possible for us to guarantee the prices displayed on Our Website. Prices change constantly and
  additional charges (e.g., payment fees, services charges, checked-in luggage fees, local taxes and fees) may apply, so you should always check whether the price asked
  for a booking is the one you expected. More details here. Some Travel Products may also be sold in another currency than the one preset or chosen by you for the display
  of the search results. Our currency conversion is for informational purposes only and should not be relied upon as accurate or real-time; actual rates may vary, and your
  payment provider (e.g., your credit card company) may charge conversion fees and apply another date&apos;s currency rate.`,

  and any fees, or in providing the Travel Products that you book. If you have any issues or disputes with your booking and/or the Travel Product, you agree
   to address and resolve these with the Travel Provider and not with us.`,

    The use of prohibited ticketing practices may result in the air carrier taking actions, including the cancellation of the ticket, denied boarding, revocation of
    frequent flier miles and other benefits, additional charges to the purchaser's credit card, additional charges collected at the airport, or future invoicing.`,
